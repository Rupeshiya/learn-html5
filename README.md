# Learn HTML5
Learn how to use HTML5 (from scratch) to build websites/web applications!

## Some history
In 1989,Tim Berners-Lee(working at CERN then) wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext systemwhere researchers can share documents. The browser and server software for this was created in the late 90's.

## What is HTML?
HTML (short for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is basically 
everything you see on the web everyday - every website uses HTML
(including GitHub, Google, Facebook, your aunt's blog, etc).
HTML is just the structure of the page - the texts, images, 
buttons **but** it doesn't include the beautifiers for your page(CSS, BootStrap).

## So HTML ain't pretty?
Plain HTML ain't but it can be made awesome looking (CSS, Bootstrap) and clickable (JS).

## Do I need to install anything to write html?
Theoretycally speaking - no,you don't. You can write on anything(even Word)
and save it in a .html extension. But truth is, if you want to make your life easier,
you should install some aditional software - Notepad, Visual Studio Code, gedit/vim/nano, Atom, Sublime, etc.
There are billions of text editors that will help you out but the one you need is probably Notepad++.

## The basics 
<ul> 
    <li> The file you create should end with .html </li>
    <li> To play(TO DO: find a more suitable verb) the file you just open it in a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) </li>
    <li> HTML doesn't include styling of the page(that's what CSS is for) </li>
</ul>

So we write html in a text editor. Than how does our PC know it's a HTML file and not a poem or essaywe've written? Easy! HTML has it's own syntax( it's close to the English language, don't worry) and it's own extension - **_.html_**

## HTML syntax

Every html starts with the tag **<!DOCTYPE html>** . This way the browser recognizes that this is a valid .html file.
You're probably wondering what a tag is. A tag is 
__< something>__ it consists of an opening tag __< something>__  and usually(not every tag has one) a closing tag __< /something>__  Eveything that's between the opening and the closing tag is affected by the action this tag does. The **<!DOCTYPE html>** doesn't have a closing tag. 
After that our html has **<**__html>__ tag
